Itâ€™s been nearly 50 years since the Apollo 11 mission landed the first human beings on the moon, 
and since astronaut Neil Armstrong took his famous first step onto the lunar surface, Or so they say.
There are still questions that need to be answered!! </p>
    <h1>
            <em>
WHAT ABOUT THE VAN ALLEN RADIATION BELTS.
            </em>
    </h1>
We need answers people! So for the ones who dont know
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.space.com/33948-van-allen-radiation-belts.html">(The Van Allen Radiation Belts)</a>
are giant donut-shaped radiation swaths of magnetically trapped, highly energetic charged particles surround Earth.
While observations have continued for decades, our knowledge of the belts became more enhanced when the Van Allen Probes launched in 2012. 
They found that the belts were more complex than previously imagined. The probes showed that the shape of the belts depends on what particle is being studied.
